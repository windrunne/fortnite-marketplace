# Fortnite Accounts Marketplace

A modern, responsive marketplace application for Fortnite accounts built with Next.js 14 App Router, React, and Tailwind CSS.

## Project Overview

This project implements a marketplace for Fortnite accounts with the following features:
- Server-side rendering (SSR) for improved performance and SEO
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Advanced filtering system with price ranges, search, and tags
- Product detail pages with comprehensive information
- Error handling and loading states
- Mock API with simulated backend

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Next.js App Router**: Leverages the latest Next.js features for server components and SSR
- **Hybrid Rendering**: Server components for initial data loading with client components for interactivity
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with dedicated mobile components
- **Component Structure**: Reusable, modular components for maintainability

### Key Features
- **Server-side Rendering**: Initial product data is fetched on the server for faster page loads
- **Advanced Filtering**: Multi-faceted filtering system with price ranges, search, and tags
- **Dynamic Product Pages**: Individual product pages with SSR data loading
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with retry functionality
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders for improved user experience

## Development Shortcuts (Due to Time Constraints)

### Visual Design
- **Color Accuracy**: Colors are approximated using Tailwind's palette rather than exact color codes
- **Font Sizing**: Font sizes may not be pixel-perfect to the design
- **Spacing**: Some spacing and padding values may differ slightly from the design

### Implementation
- **Mock Data**: Using simulated data instead of a real backend
- **Limited Product Data**: Only implemented a few sample products
- **Simplified Validation**: Basic validation without comprehensive error messaging
- **Missing Unit Tests**: No unit or integration tests implemented
- **Authentication**: No user authentication system implemented

### Mobile Experience
- **Filter Synchronization**: Basic implementation of filter state synchronization between mobile and desktop
- **Limited Animation**: Minimal animations and transitions
